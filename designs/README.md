# Designs

These are (not the highest quality) PDF exports of the Photoshop files I used to
draft up some initial designs.

They're flattened, and therefore pretty uneditable.

If you want to play with the design, or do anything besides looking at it
really, then I've uploaded the Photoshop files to Dropbox (they're a bit too big
to put in the repository).
